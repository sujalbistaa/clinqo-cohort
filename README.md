# Clinqo MCP Hackathon

Smart AI assistant backend for streamlined clinic management and doctor support

ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

This project is the intelligence and backend core for a medical clinic assistant system designed to:

- Transcribe patient voice recordings to text using OpenAI Whisper
- Extract patient information (age, gender, symptoms, duration) with NLP
- Suggest prescriptions via AI models (GPT-4 / LLaMA via Together.ai)
- Manage appointments, doctors, patients, and prescriptions through a FastAPI server
- Provide real-time updates between receptionist and doctors with WebSockets
- Support an AI feedback loop to learn doctor preferences and improve suggestions

Built as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a hackathon, all core modules are open source and modular.
